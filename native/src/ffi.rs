//! The C functions the JVM calls, and all the unsafe code there is.
//!
//! Each function turns the addresses it is given into references and
//! slices, and calls the safe code in `lib.rs`. What the JVM must get right
//! is the same for all of them:
//!
//! - A graph or collection address came from `ws_graph_new` or
//!   `ws_collection_new` and has not been freed. (The JVM side frees one
//!   only when nothing can reach the object that holds it, and a
//!   collection's object holds its graph's.)
//! - An address given with a length points to that many readable bytes,
//!   and an address to be written to has the room the function says.
//!
//! A function that can fail returns a number that says so (see each one),
//! and the reason is then read with `ws_error`. Text and lists come back
//! through `ws_result`: the function returns their length in bytes, and the
//! JVM copies them out. Both are kept per thread, so a call and the reading
//! of its error or result must be on one thread, with no other call between.
//!
//! A panic never crosses into the JVM: it is caught and reported as an error.
